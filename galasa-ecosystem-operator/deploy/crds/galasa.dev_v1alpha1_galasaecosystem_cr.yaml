  # Engine controller is responsible for bringing up engines that run the tests, it will be monitoring the 
  # queues and active tests to ensure that it only runs what the backing infrastructure can support.

  # - NodeSelector: pass any labels if you want pods to be running on a specfic node

  # Simbank is an application that can simulate an application running on a mainframe and its responses to galasa. Galasa can 
  # not differentiate Simbank from a normal mainframe application. This application can be used to test if the ecosystem is working 
  # correctly. Performing a 'kubectl get GalasaEcosystem', will show you all the ecosystems in the active namespace, whether 
  # the ecosystem is ready, and the bootstrap URL required for your IDE plugin. It also provides the URL to the grafana which can be
  # to monitior the running tests

  # The operator will bring up its own monitoring system if you dont have one. If you do not need a grafana or prometheus, please
